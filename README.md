# 3li_win_util_tool
Simple quick windows utility tool made in python. <br>
Mostly kills tasks I don't like running but also has some usefull commands. <br>
<br>
**Requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** <br>
**Run instal_requirments.py first to install the required modules.<br>You can delete requirments.txt and instal_requirments.py after as these files are no longer needed.** <br>

Then you can run 3li_Win_Util.py!
